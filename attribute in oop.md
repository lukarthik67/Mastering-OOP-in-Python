#  Attributes in Python (OOP)

##  Meaning
Attributes are data stored inside an object that describe its **state** or **properties**.  
They are like **characteristics** of the object.

---
# attributes are:  
 -Variables (instance variables, class variables)  
 -Methods (functions inside a class)  
 -Properties (special controlled attributes)  
 -Descriptors (advanced controlled attributes)  
---
##  Types of Attributes

- **Instance Attributes** → Unique to each object; change from one object to another.  
- **Class Attributes** → Shared by all objects of the same class.

---

##  Key Points
- Attributes are accessed using the **dot notation** (`object.attribute`).  
- Instance attributes belong to specific objects.  
- Class attributes are common for all objects.  
- Attributes define **what an object has**, not **what it does**.
-
In OOP, methods are the ones that define what an object does.    
Attributes → describe the data or properties of the object (what it has).  
Methods → describe the behavior or actions of the object (what it does).
