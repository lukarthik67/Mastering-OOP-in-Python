#  Understanding `__init__()` in Python

##  What is `__init__()`?
- `__init__()` is a **special method** in Python classes.
- It runs **automatically** every time you create a new object.
- Think of it as the **constructor** — it sets up the object’s **initial data**.

##  Real-Life Example: A Toy Factory
- **Class** = Blueprint of the toy.
- **Object** = Actual toy made from the blueprint.
- **`__init__()`** = The setup process — painting the toy, giving it a name, and packing it.

##  Python Example
```python
class Toy:
    def __init__(self, color, type):
        self.color = color   # Paint the toy
        self.type = type     # Decide the kind of toy

# Creating objects
toy1 = Toy("Red", "Car")
toy2 = Toy("Blue", "Robot")

print(toy1.color)  # Output: Red
print(toy2.type)   # Output: Robot
